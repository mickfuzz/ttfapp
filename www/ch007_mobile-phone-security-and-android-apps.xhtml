<ul><li>Some background info on mobile phones and security</li>

<li>How to set up a VPN on an Android phone to allow safer browsing</li>
</ul><p>Mobile phones are effective tools for organising and increasingly for documenting protest and political activism. While this is very exciting, the technology shouldn't be embraced blindly. The following information drawn from the Guardian Project website and Basic Internet Security book outlines some of the risks of mobile use and ways to overcome these threats.&#160;</p>

<h2>Security issues with mobile phones</h2>
<p><strong>Physical security</strong> - A phone can be confiscated or stolen. If you are an activist, your address book and past SMS messages might be of special interest and/ or incriminating: it can be used just to gain knowledge of your network or for further social engineering. As a minimum safety measure you should always enable some kind of password protection on your phone (not just on your SIM card).</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong> - Although the voice on a GSM (mobile phone) channel is encrypted, this encryption was hacked some time ago and is not considered safe any more. Furthermore, if you do not trust the network(s) you are using it has never been safe.</p>
<p><strong>SMS</strong>&#160; - Text messages are sent in plain text over the network, so they are also not considered secure, additionally they are not securely stored at your device, so anyone with access to it will be able to read them. If you are using an Android based phone read the section on 'Secure Text Messaging'</p>
<p><strong>Smartphones</strong> - Smartphones are quite new, and unfortunately most advanced (and even some basic) ways of securing that are available on normal computers are not available on smartphones. They pose additional risk since you are also using them for things like agendas, and personal note taking. There are a considerable number of <em>malware</em> apps on the market which are passing your personal data to other companies. Check if your app's can be trusted. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prepaid sim cards</strong> - In some countries you are still able to use prepaid locally bought SIMcards without identifying yourself. Beware that your phone also has a unique identifier (known as the IMEI number) so switching SIM cards will will not guarantee to protect your privacy.</p>
<h2>Useful Android Apps</h2>
<p>The <strong>FDroid Repository</strong> is a catalogue of FOSS applications for the Android platform. Their website is a great first port of call if you are looking at installing some tools for your phone - http://f-droid.org/</p>
