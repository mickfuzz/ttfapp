	<p>This booklet provides an introduction to the effective use of
		technology for activism, with links to step-by-step guides and further
		information. It is written with a UK focus; we invite people to
		translate it to their own languages and cultures.</p>

	<h3>Free Software and Free Network Services</h3>
	<p>Nearly all of the tools discussed in this booklet are free
		software based. Free software programmers dedicate millions of hours
		to writing virus-free, highly secure software that respects your
		privacy. You may already know Firefox, OpenOffice, and GNU/Linux
		operating systems such as Ubuntu and Mint Linux, which are used by
		hundreds of millions of people worldwide. <a class="item" href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.twitter.com/nraboy', '_system', 'location=yes'); return false;">

				<em>"The long revolution is creating small federated
					microsocieties, true guerilla cells practising and fighting for
					this self-management. Effective radicality authorises all
					variations and guarantees every freedom."</em> Raoul Vaneigem

		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The same philosophy can be applied to online <strong>network
				services -</strong>&#160;social networking and video sharing sites such as
			Facebook and YouTube. Many people are creating free network services
			which support federation and freedom for the information users
			contribute; these issues are explained in a talk by Eben Moglen,
			"Freedom in the Cloud". <strong><a

		<h3>Introduction to safer communication</h3>
		<p>Over the last two decades the information revolution has
			radically changed the way political activists communicate; but
			alongside the new opportunities, there remains the age-old problem of
			how to get information to your allies confidentialy. Using an alias
			(or aliases) is an equally old but still effective security
			technique.</p>
		<p>As long as very few people know the connection between your
			online and real identities, it will not be easy to discover your
			identity if your alias is incriminated. This requires having an email
			provider who will not (or cannot) disclose your personal details if
			they are pressured by the police.&#160;Communicating securely is
			everyone's business. Even if your activism is currently legal, you
			can help make the internet safer for everyone and help the "open web"
			with some of these security practices.</p>
