      &#160;This chapter will:
     </p>
     <ul class = "list">
      <li class="item">
       <i class="icon ion-star"></i>
       recommend secure blogs and websites
      </li>
      <li class="item">
       <i class="icon ion-star"></i>
       discuss the issues of anonymous blogging
      </li>
      <li class="item">
       <i class="icon ion-star"></i>
       explore different ways and tools to blog anonymously
      </li>
     </ul><h3>Issues with mainstream blogging sites</h3>
     <p>
      Many activists and campaign groups use free blog sites such as Blogger.com or Wordpress.com. However, these sites log IP addresses that reveal users' identities, and can be required by court decisions to reveal this information. There have been cases where Wordpress.com has handed over identities of bloggers and taken down websites on request of the authorities. Fortunately, anonymous blogging is possible (see also the chapter on using VPN, Tor and other ways to browse the internet anonymously).
     </p>
     <p><img src="static/anon_logo.png" alt="" width="300" height="300"/>
     </p>
     <h3>Use secure blogging services&#160;</h3>
     <p>
      We define "secure" as not logging IP addresses or any details of those who are uploading to or viewing the site.&#160;
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>Network23.org</strong> is one secure blogging service; they do not log any personal data, apart from your email address for password resets. You can sign up for an account from an independent email (see the chapter on email for more information) for complete anonymity.&#160;Other blogging services that don't log IP addresses include <strong>https://blogsport.eu</strong> and <strong>https://noblogs.org</strong>
     </p>
     <h3>Get more secure hosting</h3>
     <p>
      Wordpress is free software that you can install on your own server. If your server is configured correctly, &#160;and you istall the&#160;<strong>remove ip</strong>&#160;module for Apache [<a title="ttfa.net/removeip" href="http://ttfa.net/removeip"><strong>ttfa.net/removeip</strong></a>],you can ensure your blogs do not capture users' personal data. Other website software such as Joomla or Drupal can also be set up in this way.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong><a title="ttfa.net/removeip" href="https://tachanka.org/">Tachana.org</a></strong> offer secure privacy-concious website hosting to radical and grassroots groups internationally.&#160;<strong><a title="ttfa.net/removeip" href="https://ox4.org/">ox4.org</a></strong>&#160;was set up by activists in the Oxford area who "like doing activism, supporting activism infrastructure, and techie stuff". Their level of security is not as high as Tachanka.
     </p>
     <h3>Wordpress Networks</h3>
     <p>
      If you want to set up your own anonymous blogging service, a&#160;<strong>Wordpress Network&#160;</strong>is a good way to save time and effort. This is a multi-user set-up which reduces the site administrators' workload: when you update the code for the main site, all subsites are also updated.&#160;
     </p>
     <p>
      The process of using a Wordpress network blog is nearly identical to a normal Wordpress blog. There is a basic help guide on the FlossManuals site: <a title="ttfa.net/removeip" href="http://ttfa.net/flosswp"><strong>ttfa.net/flosswp</strong></a>
